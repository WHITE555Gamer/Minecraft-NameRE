Note: Some descriptions using DeepL Translate.

NameRE is mini-plugin forÂ  easier name edit or redirect in spigot multi-server plugin.

It is recommended to use a stable plugin.
However, this plugin does not make big changes to Minecraft.
Therefore, any version of this plugin can be expected to work reliably.
A snapshot plugin can see the features early, but It doesn't have a stable system. And, it will not always be adopted next time.
Version system continues like below: snapshot (unstable), alpha (partially unstable), beta (stable), then release (mostly stable).
It uses the system that some players already have, so it may interfere with other plugins and other commands. If anyone is testing this plugin, please test it in detail and report the situation.
