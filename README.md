Note: Some descriptions using DeepL Translator.

NameRE is mini-plugin for easier name edit or reset in spigot server.

It is recommended to use a stable version plugin.
However, this plugin doesn't make big changes to Minecraft.
Therefore, any version of this plugin can be expected to work reliably.
A snapshot plugin can see the features early, but It doesn't have a stable system. And, it'll not always be adopted next time.
Version system continues like below: snapshot (unstable), alpha (partially unstable), beta (stable), then release (mostly stable).
It uses the system that some players already have, so it may interfere with other plugins and other commands. If anyone is testing this plugin, please report it in detail and report the situation.
